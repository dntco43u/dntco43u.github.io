The deprecation will be included as warnings at build time. The capability will be removed in a future release.
Adding support for ctype=CORD in C++ v23 will add ctype=CORD support for singular bytes fields, including oneof fields, to specify that data should be stored using absl::cord instead of string. Support may be added in future releases for singular string field types and for repeated string and byte fields if there is enough interest from the open source community.</description></item><item><title>Changes announced April 20, 2023</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-04-20/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-04-20/</guid><description>Changes to Ruby Generator This GitHub PR, which will appear in the 23.x release, changes the Ruby code generator to emit a serialized proto instead of the DSL.
It removes the DSL from the code generator in anticipation of splitting the DSL out into a separate package.

Going forward, any valid Unicode characters will be accepted, except \u0000. Null will still be allowed in field values.
Previously, the proto compiler allowed null characters, but support for this was inconsistent across languages and implementations. To fix this, we are clarifying the spec to say that null is not allowed in json_name, and will be rejected by the compiler.</description></item><item><title>Changes Announced on August 15, 2023</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-08-15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-08-15/</guid><description>Python Breaking Change In v25 message.UnknownFields() will be deprecated in pure Python and C++ extensions.

JSON Formatter Option Changes Starting in the 26.x line, the JSON formatter option to print default-valued fields is replaced with a fixed way to handle proto2 and proto3 optional fields consistently.
Java: includingDefaultValueFields() is replaced with alwaysPrintFieldsWithNoPresence(). C++: always_print_default_values is replaced with always_print_fields_with_no_presence=True.

While there is no requirement to move from proto2/proto3 syntax to Editions syntax at initial release, we encourage you to plan a move in your software project&amp;rsquo;s future timeline.
Protobuf Editions Protobuf Editions replace the proto2 and proto3 designations that we have used for Protocol Buffers. Instead of adding syntax = &amp;quot;proto2&amp;quot; or syntax = &amp;quot;proto3&amp;quot; at the top of proto definition files, you use an edition number, such as edition = &amp;quot;2024&amp;quot;, to specify the default behaviors your file will have.</description></item><item><title>Changes announced May 6, 2022</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2022-05-06/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2022-05-06/</guid><description>Versioning We changed our versioning scheme to enable more-nimble updates to language-specific parts of Protocol Buffers. In the new scheme, each language has its own major version that can be incremented independently of other languages, as covered later in this topic with the Python release. The minor and patch versions, however, will remain coupled. This allows us to introduce breaking changes into some languages without requiring a bump of the major version in languages that do not experience a breaking change.</description></item><item><title>Changes announced on October 10, 2023</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-10-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-10-10/</guid><description>Protobuf Editions Features Documentation that introduces Protobuf Editions features is now available.</description></item><item><title>Search Results</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/search/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Changes announced on September 15, 2023</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-09-15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-09-15/</guid><description>μpb Moving to the Protobuf Git Repository Starting with the v25 release, μpb now lives in the protobuf repo instead of in its former location in a separate repo. All μpb development going forward will take place only in the new location.
The merger of the two repos will simplify and speed up our development process by removing the need to update pinned version dependencies between protobuf and μpb. Changes to μpb now take effect immediately in protobuf code and vice versa, without the need for a manual upgrade step.</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 21.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v21/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 21.x.

Python Updates We made some changes in Python language support in Protocol Buffers. Version 4.21.0 is a new major version, following 3.20.1. The new version is based on the upb library, and offers significantly better parsing performance than previous releases, especially for large payloads. It also includes prebuilt binary modules for Apple silicon for increased performance without a manual build.</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 22.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v22/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 22.x.

Changing Maven Release Candidate Artifact Names to Be More Idiomatic In 22.0 we plan to rename Maven artifacts to use “RC” instead of “rc-” as the release candidate prefix.
Adding an Abseil Dependency In order to reduce the Google vs. OSS differences between protobuf and to simplify our own project, we plan to take a formal dependency on Abseil.</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 23.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v23/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 23.x.

Changes to Ruby Generator This GitHub PR, which will appear in the 23.x release, changes the Ruby code generator to emit a serialized proto instead of the DSL.
It removes the DSL from the code generator in anticipation of splitting the DSL out into a separate package.
Given a .proto file like:
syntax = &amp;#34;proto3&amp;#34;; package pkg; message TestMessage { optional int32 i32 = 1; optional TestMessage msg = 2; } Generated code before:</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 24.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v24/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 24.x.

Stricter validation for json_name v24 will forbid embedded null characters in the json_name field option. Going forward, any valid Unicode characters will be accepted, except \u0000. Null will still be allowed in field values.
Previously, the proto compiler allowed null characters, but support for this was inconsistent across languages and implementations. To fix this, we are clarifying the spec to say that null is not allowed in json_name, and will be rejected by the compiler.</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 25.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v25/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v25/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 25.x.

Python Breaking Change In v25 message.UnknownFields() will be deprecated in pure Python and C++ extensions. It will be removed in v26. Use the new UnknownFieldSet(message) support in unknown_fields.py as a replacement.
μpb Moving to the Protobuf Git Repository Starting with the v25 release, μpb now lives in the protobuf repo instead of in its former location in a separate repo.</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 26.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v26/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 26.x. For information presented chronologically, see News.
General Changes JSON Formatter Option Changes Starting in the 26.x line, the JSON formatter option to print default-valued fields is replaced with a fixed way to handle proto2 and proto3 optional fields consistently.
Java: includingDefaultValueFields() is replaced with alwaysPrintFieldsWithNoPresence(). C++: always_print_default_values is replaced with always_print_fields_with_no_presence=True. Py: including_default_value_fields=True is replaced with always_print_fields_with_no_presence=True. The new flag behaves identically to the old flag on proto3 messages, but no longer applies to proto2 optional fields.</description></item></channel></rss>
