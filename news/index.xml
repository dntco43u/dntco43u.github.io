JSON Formatter Option Changes Starting in the 26.x line, the JSON formatter option to print default-valued fields is replaced with a fixed way to handle proto2 and proto3 optional fields consistently.
Java: includingDefaultValueFields() is replaced with alwaysPrintFieldsWithNoPresence(). C++: always_print_default_values is replaced with always_print_fields_with_no_presence=True. Py: including_default_value_fields=True is replaced with always_print_fields_with_no_presence=True.

Python Breaking Changes Removing setup.py and setup.cfg support from GitHub In the 26.x release, setup.py and setup.cfg will no longer be present in the python/ directory of the GitHub repository or GitHub release tarballs. This means it will no longer be possible to build a Python package directly from the GitHub repo or release tarball.
The Python source packages published on PyPI will continue to have a setup.</description></item><item><title>Changes announced January 5, 2024</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2024-01-05/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2024-01-05/</guid><description>This topic covers breaking changes in Ruby and Python in the 26.x line.
Ruby Breaking Changes Freeze Is Now Recursive in Ruby Starting in the 26.x line, when freeze is applied it will be applied recursively, affecting all sub-messages, maps, and repeated fields.
Python Breaking Changes Removing Deprecated APIs In the 26.x release, the following deprecated APIs will be removed:
AddFileDescriptor AddDescriptor AddEnumDescriptor AddExtensionDescriptor AddServiceDescriptor Rejecting Extend Repeated Field with None Iterable Starting in the 26.</description></item><item><title>Changes announced on October 10, 2023</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-10-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-10-10/</guid><description>Protobuf Editions Features Documentation that introduces Protobuf Editions features is now available.</description></item><item><title>Changes announced on September 15, 2023</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-09-15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/2023-09-15/</guid><description>μpb Moving to the Protobuf Git Repository Starting with the v25 release, μpb now lives in the protobuf repo instead of in its former location in a separate repo. All μpb development going forward will take place only in the new location.
The merger of the two repos will simplify and speed up our development process by removing the need to update pinned version dependencies between protobuf and μpb. Changes to μpb now take effect immediately in protobuf code and vice versa, without the need for a manual upgrade step.</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 21.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v21/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 21.x. For information presented chronologically, see News.
Python Updates We made some changes in Python language support in Protocol Buffers. Version 4.21.0 is a new major version, following 3.20.1. The new version is based on the upb library, and offers significantly better parsing performance than previous releases, especially for large payloads. It also includes prebuilt binary modules for Apple silicon for increased performance without a manual build.</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 22.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v22/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 22.x.

Changing Maven Release Candidate Artifact Names to Be More Idiomatic In 22.0 we plan to rename Maven artifacts to use “RC” instead of “rc-” as the release candidate prefix.
Adding an Abseil Dependency In order to reduce the Google vs. OSS differences between protobuf and to simplify our own project, we plan to take a formal dependency on Abseil.</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 23.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v23/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 23.x.

Changes to Ruby Generator This GitHub PR, which will appear in the 23.x release, changes the Ruby code generator to emit a serialized proto instead of the DSL.
It removes the DSL from the code generator in anticipation of splitting the DSL out into a separate package.
Given a .proto file like:
syntax = &amp;#34;proto3&amp;#34;; package pkg; message TestMessage { optional int32 i32 = 1; optional TestMessage msg = 2; } Generated code before:</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 24.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v24/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 24.x. For information presented chronologically, see News.
Stricter validation for json_name v24 will forbid embedded null characters in the json_name field option. Going forward, any valid Unicode characters will be accepted, except \u0000. Null will still be allowed in field values.
Previously, the proto compiler allowed null characters, but support for this was inconsistent across languages and implementations. To fix this, we are clarifying the spec to say that null is not allowed in json_name, and will be rejected by the compiler.</description></item><item><title>News Announcements for Version 25.x</title><link>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v25/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hu.gvp6nx1a.duckdns.org/news/v25/</guid><description>The following announcements are specific to Version 25.x.

Python Breaking Change In v25 message.UnknownFields() will be deprecated in pure Python and C++ extensions. It will be removed in v26. Use the new UnknownFieldSet(message) support in unknown_fields.py as a replacement.
