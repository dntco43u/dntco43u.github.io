Use these to choose your core tasks. Each granular use case (enable x, configure y) should have a corresponding tasks page or tasks page section. Users should be able to quickly refer to your core tasks when they need to find out how to do one specific thing, rather than having to look for the instructions in a bigger tutorial or example. Think of your tasks pages as a cookbook with different procedures your users can combine to create something more substantial.\nYou can give each task a page, or you can group related tasks together in a page, such as tasks related to a particular feature. As well as grouping related tasks in single pages, you can also group task pages in nested folders with an index page as an overview, as seen in this example site. Or if you have a small docset like the Docsy User Guide with no Tutorials or Concepts pages, consider adding your feature-specific pages at the top level of your docs rather than in a Tasks section.\nEach task should give the user\nThe prerequisites for this task, if any (this can be specified at the top of a multi-task page if they’re the same for all the page’s tasks. “All these tasks assume that you understand….and that you have already….”). What this task accomplishes. Instructions for the task. If it involves editing a file, running a command, or writing code, provide code-formatted example snippets to show the user what to do! If there are multiple steps, provide them as a numbered list. If appropriate, links to related concept, tutorial, or example pages.

If you have already created some Examples for your project you can base Tutorials on them. This section is optional. However, remember that although you may not need this section at first, having tutorials can be useful to help your users engage with your example code, especially if there are aspects that need more explanation than you can easily provide in code comments.\n","categories":"","description":"Show your user how to work through some end to end examples.","excerpt":"Show your user how to work through some end to end examples.","ref":"/tutorials/","tags":"","title":"Tutorials"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\nIf your project has an API, configuration, or other reference - anything that users need to look up that’s at an even lower level than a single task - put (or link to it) here. You can serve and link to generated reference docs created using Doxygen, Javadoc, or other doc generation tools by putting them in your static/ directory. Find out more in Adding static content. For OpenAPI reference, Docsy also provides a Swagger UI layout and shortcode that renders Swagger UI using any OpenAPI YAML or JSON file as source.\n","categories":"","description":"Low level reference docs for your project.","excerpt":"Low level reference docs for your project.","ref":"/reference/","tags":"","title":"Reference"},{"body":" These basic sample guidelines assume that your Docsy site is deployed using Netlify and your files are stored in GitHub. You can use the guidelines “as is” or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project’s file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon’t forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\nWe use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\nFork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers. Updating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\nClick Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes. Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\nFollow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\nFork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\nContinue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\nCreating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.

The deprecation will be included as warnings at build time. The capability will be removed in a future release.\nAdding support for ctype=CORD in C++ v23 will add ctype=CORD support for singular bytes fields, including oneof fields, to specify that data should be stored using absl::cord instead of string. Support may be added in future releases for singular string field types and for repeated string and byte fields if there is enough interest from the open source community.\nctype=CORD will have no effect on extensions.\nYou will be able to add the support using field options:\noptional bytes foo = 25 [ctype=CORD]; Option Retention Options now have a notion of retention, which controls whether an option is retained in the generated code. Options have always had runtime retention by default, meaning that they are retained in the generated code and are thus visible at runtime in the generated descriptor pool. However, you can now set retention = RETENTION_SOURCE to specify that an option (or field within an option) must not be retained at runtime. This is called source retention.\nSetting retention looks like this:\nextend google.protobuf.FileOptions { optional int32 source_retention_option = 1234 [retention = RETENTION_SOURCE]; } It can also be set on a plain field, in which case it takes effect only when that field appears inside an option:\nmessage OptionsMessage { optional int32 source_retention_field = 1 [retention = RETENTION_SOURCE]; } For more information, see Option Retention.\nDropping Support for Bazel \u003c5.3 v23 will drop support for Bazel 4. Protobuf will continue to support the Bazel 5 LTS with Bazel 5.3 as the minimum required version. This is per the build support policy described in Foundational C++ Support Policy and as reflected in the versions in Foundational C++ Support.\n","categories":"","description":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on April 11, 2023.","excerpt":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on April 11, 2023.","ref":"/news/2023-04-11/","tags":"","title":"Changes announced April 11, 2023"},{"body":"Changes to Ruby Generator This GitHub PR, which will appear in the 23.x release, changes the Ruby code generator to emit a serialized proto instead of the DSL.\nIt removes the DSL from the code generator in anticipation of splitting the DSL out into a separate package.\nGiven a .proto file like:\nsyntax = \"proto3\"; package pkg; message TestMessage { optional int32 i32 = 1; optional TestMessage msg = 2; } Generated code before:\n# Generated by the protocol buffer compiler.

This is a side effect of moving from the DSL (which is lossy) to a serialized descriptor (which preserves all information).\nBackward Compatibility This change should be 100% compatible with Ruby Protobuf \u003e= 3.18.0, released in Sept 2021. Additionally, it should be compatible with all existing users and deployments.\nThere is some special compatibility code inserted to achieve this level of backward compatibility that you should be aware of. Without the compatibility code, there is an edge case that could break backward compatibility. The previous code is lax in a way that the new code will be more strict.\nWhen using a full serialized descriptor, it contains a list of all .proto files imported by this file (whereas the DSL never added dependencies properly). See the code in descriptor.proto.\nadd_serialized_file verifies that all dependencies listed in the descriptor were previously added with add_serialized_file. Generally that should be fine, because the generated code will contain Ruby require statements for all dependencies, and the descriptor will fail to load anyway if the types depended on were not previously defined in the DescriptorPool.\nBut there is a potential for problems if there are ambiguities around file paths. For example, consider the following scenario:\n// foo/bar.proto syntax = \"proto2\"; message Bar {} // foo/baz.proto syntax = \"proto2\"; import \"bar.proto\"; message Baz { optional Bar bar = 1; } If you invoke protoc like so, it will work correctly:\n$ protoc --ruby_out=. -Ifoo foo/bar.proto foo/baz.proto $ RUBYLIB=. ruby baz_pb.rb However if you invoke protoc like so, and didn’t have any compatibility code, it would fail to load:\n$ protoc --ruby_out=. -I. -Ifoo foo/baz.proto $ protoc --ruby_out=. -I. -Ifoo foo/bar.proto $ RUBYLIB=foo ruby foo/baz_pb.rb foo/baz_pb.rb:10:in `add_serialized_file': Unable to build file to DescriptorPool: Depends on file 'bar.proto', but it has not been loaded (Google::Protobuf::TypeError) from foo/baz_pb.rb:10:in `\u003cmain\u003e' The problem is that bar.proto is being referred to by two different canonical names: bar.proto and foo/bar.proto. This is a user error: each import should always be referred to by a consistent full path. Hopefully user errors of this sort will be rare, but it is hard to know without trying.\nThe code in this change prints a warning using warn if we detect that this edge case has occurred:\n$ RUBYLIB=foo ruby foo/baz_pb.rb Warning: Protobuf detected an import path issue while loading generated file foo/baz_pb.rb - foo/baz.proto imports bar.proto, but that import was loaded as foo/bar.proto Each proto file must use a consistent fully-qualified name. This will become an error in the next major version. There are two possible fixes in this case. One is to consistently use the name bar.proto for the import (removing -I.). The other is to consistently use the name foo/bar.proto for the import (changing the import line to import \"foo/bar.proto\" and removing -Ifoo).\nWe plan to remove this compatibility code in the next major version.\n","categories":"","description":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on April 20, 2023.","excerpt":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on April 20, 2023.","ref":"/news/2023-04-20/","tags":"","title":"Changes announced April 20, 2023"},{"body":"Stricter validation for json_name v24 will forbid embedded null characters in the json_name field option.

The section currently covers C++ and PHP, but may be expanded with information about other platforms in the future.\nOfficial C++ Support Matrix With the policy, mentioned earlier in this announcement, of using Google’s official foundational C++ support policy, our C++ compiler and toolchain support matrix will change.\nC++ Changes Following the announcement of our new major version and breaking changes policy, we are planning a major version bump for C++. We plan to make some changes to the assets that we release starting with our 22.x release line.\nThe following sections outline the set of breaking changes that we plan to include in the 22.0 release of protocol buffers. Note that plans can and do change. These are potential breaking changes to be aware of, but they may not happen in this particular release, or they may not happen at all.\nAdding C++20 Support Because of the addition of new keywords to the C++ language, adding support for C++20 is a breaking change for users even if they do not currently use C++20.\nMitigations for this to conditionally change names only in certain compiler modes would break projects that support multiple language standards.\nDropping C++11 Support Per our C++ support policy, we plan to drop C++11 support. This is a breaking change.\nDropping Autotools Support Per our build systems support policy, we plan to drop autotools support. This is a breaking change. After autotools support is dropped, protobuf will support only CMake and Bazel.\nDropping Support for PHP \u003c7.4 Per our PHP support policy, we plan to drop support for EOL versions of PHP. This is not considered a breaking change since these versions are already EOL in the broader ecosystem.\nAdding an Abseil Dependency In order to reduce the Google vs. OSS differences between protobuf and to simplify our own project, we plan to take a formal dependency on Abseil. In time, we plan to start using Abseil types in our public APIs, but simply adding the dependency is a breaking change.\nDropping Language-Specific Source Distributions To reduce dependence on autotools and minimize the number of artifacts we release, we plan to stop publishing language-specific source distributions on our GitHub release page. Instead, we advise users to download the source code distribution automatically generated by GitHub on the release page.\nChanging Maven Release Candidate Artifact Names to Be More Idiomatic In 22.0 we plan to rename Maven artifacts to use “RC” instead of “rc-” as the release candidate prefix.\n","categories":"","description":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on August 3, 2022.","excerpt":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on August 3, 2022.","ref":"/news/2022-08-03/","tags":"","title":"Changes announced August 3, 2022"},{"body":".NET support policy The Protobuf team supports .NET in two ways:\nGeneration of C# code by protoc The Google.Protobuf NuGet package, which provides runtime support for the generated code, as well as reflection and other facilities The support policy for these has previously been unclear, particularly in terms of which .NET runtimes are supported. From August 2023 onwards, support will be provided in accordance with the Google Open Source support policy for .NET. We expect this to mean that some old versions of .NET will be dropped from the Google.Protobuf package without taking a new major version.\nProtobuf is relatively unusual within Google projects supporting .NET in two respects: Firstly, as we support generating C# which we expect customers to compile, we need to consider language versions as well as runtime versions. The current policy does not cover this aspect of support, so we will publish a separate policy for this. Secondly, while Unity is not a first-class supported platform, we understand that Protobuf is commonly used on Unity, and we will intend to avoid breaking that usage as far as is reasonably possible.\nMore details will be published when a new set of target platforms has been decided for Google.Protobuf. This will be at least one month ahead of the release in which it will take effect, in order to provide time for community feedback. For now, we recommend that users review the support policy.\n","categories":"","description":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on August 9, 2023.","excerpt":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on August 9, 2023.","ref":"/news/2023-08-09/","tags":"","title":"Changes Announced on August 9, 2023"},{"body":"C++ Breaking Changes In v26, we are planning a major version bump for C++ as per our breaking changes policy and version support policy.\nThe following sections outline the set of breaking changes that we plan to include in the 26.0 release of protocol buffers.

Instead, use the various feature helpers defined in descriptor.h to query more targeted behaviors, such as has_presence, to query features in C++.\nRemove deprecated syntax accessor We plan to remove the deprecated syntax accessor, FileDescriptor::Syntax, in v26. We recommend using the getters from FileDescriptor::edition instead.\nRemove deprecated SupportsUnknownEnumValues method The SupportsUnknownEnumValues method was deprecated in March, 2023.

We plan to introduce “poison pills” to detect and enforce these disallowed mismatches.\nThis is not considered a breaking change since this simply adds enforcement of existing policies, but may require users to update their generated code.\nBreaking Compatibility with Old Generated Code v26.x will break compatibility with generated code from older major versions.

While there is no requirement to move from proto2/proto3 syntax to Editions syntax at initial release, we encourage you to plan a move in your software project’s future timeline.\nProtobuf Editions Protobuf Editions replace the proto2 and proto3 designations that we have used for Protocol Buffers. Instead of adding syntax = \"proto2\" or syntax = \"proto3\" at the top of proto definition files, you use an edition number, such as edition = \"2024\", to specify the default behaviors your file will have. Editions enable the language to evolve incrementally over time.\nInstead of the hardcoded behaviors in older versions, editions will represent a collection of “features” with a default value (behavior) per feature, which you can override. Features are options on a file, message, field, enum, and so on that specify the behavior of protoc, the code generators, and protobuf runtimes. You can explicitly override the desired behavior at those different levels (file, message, field, …) when your needs don’t match the default behavior for the edition you’ve selected.\nEditions won’t break existing binaries, and the first edition will be minimally disruptive; it will establish the baseline and will combine proto2 and proto3 definitions into a new single definition format. It won’t require any changes to your code. We will be providing a tool, called Prototiller, to migrate .proto files. The following examples show a proto2 definition file and a proto3 file, and what each might look like after using Prototiller to convert them to Protobuf Editions format:\nProto2 syntax // proto2 file syntax = \"proto2\"; message Player { // in proto2, optional fields have explicit presence optional string name = 1; // proto2 still supports the problematic \"required\" field rule required int32 id = 2; // in proto2 this is not packed by default repeated int32 scores = 3; enum Handed { HANDED_UNSPECIFIED = 0, HANDED_LEFT = 1, HANDED_RIGHT = 2, HANDED_AMBIDEXTROUS = 3, } // in proto2 enums are closed optional Handed handed = 4; } Editions syntax // Editions version of proto2 file edition = \"2023\"; message Player { string name = 1; int32 id = 2 [features.field_presence = LEGACY_REQUIRED]; repeated int32 scores = 3 [features.repeated_field_encoding = EXPANDED]; enum Handed { // this overrides the default Edition 2023 behavior, which is OPEN option features.enum = CLOSED; HANDED_UNSPECIFIED = 0, HANDED_LEFT = 1, HANDED_RIGHT = 2, HANDED_AMBIDEXTROUS = 3, } Handed handed = 4; } And this is what a similar proto3 definition file might look like:\nProto3 syntax // proto3 file syntax = \"proto3\"; message Player { // in proto3, optional fields have explicit presence optional string name = 1; // in proto3 no specified field rule defaults to implicit presence int32 id = 2; // in proto3 this is packed by default repeated int32 scores = 3; enum Handed { HANDED_UNSPECIFIED = 0, HANDED_LEFT = 1, HANDED_RIGHT = 2, HANDED_AMBIDEXTROUS = 3, } // in proto3 enums are open optional Handed handed = 4; } Editions syntax // Editions version of proto3 file edition = \"2023\"; message Player { string name = 1; int32 id = 2 [features.field_presence = IMPLICIT]; repeated int32 scores = 3; enum Handed { HANDED_UNSPECIFIED = 0, HANDED_LEFT = 1, HANDED_RIGHT = 2, HANDED_AMBIDEXTROUS = 3, } Handed handed = 4; } While the examples provided in this topic show a direct translation of proto2 and proto3 to the equivalent representation using Protobuf Editions, you will be able to mix and match the settings to your project’s needs.\nFeatures have a lifecycle that is governed by the releases of editions. For example, features.awesome_new_feature might be added in Edition 2031, with the new behavior applying to all definitions that don’t explicitly override the new behavior. In Edition 2033, the new feature is deprecated. Overrides still work, but developers are alerted to the fact that they need to adapt to the new behavior soon. In Edition 2036, the feature is removed and the new behavior applies to all protos; there is no way to override the new behavior at this point.\nFigure 1: Editions lifecycle flowchart\nEditions are planned to be released roughly once a year.

In the new scheme, each language has its own major version that can be incremented independently of other languages, as covered later in this topic with the Python release. The minor and patch versions, however, will remain coupled. This allows us to introduce breaking changes into some languages without requiring a bump of the major version in languages that do not experience a breaking change.\nThe first instance of this new versioning scheme is the new version of the Python API, 4.21.0, which follows the preceding version, 3.20.1. Other language APIs will be released as 3.21.0.\nPython Updates We made some changes in Python language support in Protocol Buffers. Version 4.21.0 is a new major version, following 3.20.1. The new version is based on the upb library, and offers significantly better parsing performance than previous releases, especially for large payloads. It also includes prebuilt binary modules for Apple silicon for increased performance without a manual build.\nThe new release does contain some breaking changes. Specifically:\nThe UnknownFields() method, which relied on an implicitly created class, is replaced with the explicitly-created UnknownFieldSet class. Some non-core characteristics may have changed, such as the specific format of certain strings or error messages. These are not considered breaking changes, but may still impact your existing code base. Applications that rely on sharing messages between Python and C++ break in the new version. Most developers won’t be affected by this, but users of Nucleus and possibly other libraries may be. As a workaround, you can set an environment variable that forces the library to preserve compatibility. Python upb requires generated code that has been generated from protoc 3.19.0 or newer. JavaScript Support We moved some things around for Protocol Buffer support of JavaScript to allow JavaScript to evolve and release independently of the main repo. Specifically, we decoupled the language support from the main project and moved it into its own repository.\nIf you have created any pull requests related to JavaScript support in Protocol Buffers that you’d still like to merge, feel free to replicate those against the JavaScript repository. We will transfer GitHub issues automatically.\n","categories":"","description":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on May 6, 2022.","excerpt":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on May 6, 2022.","ref":"/news/2022-05-06/","tags":"","title":"Changes announced May 6, 2022"},{"body":"Protobuf Editions Features Documentation that introduces Protobuf Editions features is now available.\n","categories":"","description":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on October 10, 2023.","excerpt":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers on October 10, 2023.","ref":"/news/2023-10-10/","tags":"","title":"Changes announced on October 10, 2023"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/search/","tags":"","title":"Search Results"},{"body":"μpb Moving to the Protobuf Git Repository Starting with the v25 release, μpb now lives in the protobuf repo instead of in its former location in a separate repo.

For information presented chronologically, see News.\nChanging Maven Release Candidate Artifact Names to Be More Idiomatic In 22.0 we plan to rename Maven artifacts to use “RC” instead of “rc-” as the release candidate prefix.\nAdding an Abseil Dependency In order to reduce the Google vs. OSS differences between protobuf and to simplify our own project, we plan to take a formal dependency on Abseil. In time, we plan to start using Abseil types in our public APIs, but simply adding the dependency is a breaking change.\nDropping Support for PHP \u003c7.4 Per our PHP support policy, we plan to drop support for EOL versions of PHP. This is not considered a breaking change since these versions are already EOL in the broader ecosystem.\nDropping Autotools Support Per our build systems support policy, we plan to drop autotools support. This is a breaking change. After autotools support is dropped, protobuf will support only CMake and Bazel.\nDropping C++11 Support Per our C++ support policy, we plan to drop C++11 support. This is a breaking change.\nAdding C++20 Support Because of the addition of new keywords to the C++ language, adding support for C++20 is a breaking change for users even if they do not currently use C++20.\nMitigations for this to conditionally change names only in certain compiler modes would break projects that support multiple language standards.\nC++ Changes Following the announcement of our new major version and breaking changes policy, we are planning a major version bump for C++.

These are potential breaking changes to be aware of, but they may not happen in this particular release, or they may not happen at all.\n","categories":"","description":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers version 22.x.","excerpt":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers version 22.x.","ref":"/news/v22/","tags":"","title":"News Announcements for Version 22.x"},{"body":"The following announcements are specific to Version 23.x. For information presented chronologically, see News.\nChanges to Ruby Generator This GitHub PR, which will appear in the 23.x release, changes the Ruby code generator to emit a serialized proto instead of the DSL.\nIt removes the DSL from the code generator in anticipation of splitting the DSL out into a separate package.\nGiven a .proto file like:\nsyntax = \"proto3\"; package pkg; message TestMessage { optional int32 i32 = 1; optional TestMessage msg = 2; } Generated code before:\n# Generated by the protocol buffer compiler. DO NOT EDIT! # source: protoc_explorer/main.proto require 'google/protobuf' Google::Protobuf::DescriptorPool.generated_pool.build do add_file(\"test.proto\", :syntax =\u003e :proto3) do add_message \"pkg.TestMessage\" do proto3_optional :i32, :int32, 1 proto3_optional :msg, :message, 2, \"pkg.TestMessage\" end end end module Pkg TestMessage = ::Google::Protobuf::DescriptorPool.generated_pool.lookup(\"pkg.TestMessage\").msgclass end Generated code after:\n# frozen_string_literal: true # Generated by the protocol buffer compiler. DO NOT EDIT! # source: test.proto require 'google/protobuf' descriptor_data = \"\\n\\ntest.proto\\x12\\x03pkg\\\"S\\n\\x0bTestMessage\\x12\\x10\\n\\x03i32\\x18\\x01 \\x01(\\x05H\\x00\\x88\\x01\\x01\\x12\\\"\\n\\x03msg\\x18\\x02 \\x01(\\x0b\\x32\\x10.pkg.TestMessageH\\x01\\x88\\x01\\x01\\x42\\x06\\n\\x04_i32B\\x06\\n\\x04_msgb\\x06proto3\" begin Google::Protobuf::DescriptorPool.generated_pool.add_serialized_file(descriptor_data) rescue TypeError =\u003e e # \u003ccompatibility code, see below\u003e end module Pkg TestMessage = ::Google::Protobuf::DescriptorPool.generated_pool.lookup(\"pkg.TestMessage\").msgclass end This change fixes nearly all remaining conformance problems that existed previously. This is a side effect of moving from the DSL (which is lossy) to a serialized descriptor (which preserves all information).\nBackward Compatibility This change should be 100% compatible with Ruby Protobuf \u003e= 3.18.0, released in Sept 2021. Additionally, it should be compatible with all existing users and deployments.\nThere is some special compatibility code inserted to achieve this level of backward compatibility that you should be aware of. Without the compatibility code, there is an edge case that could break backward compatibility. The previous code is lax in a way that the new code will be more strict.\nWhen using a full serialized descriptor, it contains a list of all .proto files imported by this file (whereas the DSL never added dependencies properly). See the code in descriptor.proto.\nadd_serialized_file verifies that all dependencies listed in the descriptor were previously added with add_serialized_file. Generally that should be fine, because the generated code will contain Ruby require statements for all dependencies, and the descriptor will fail to load anyway if the types depended on were not previously defined in the DescriptorPool.\nBut there is a potential for problems if there are ambiguities around file paths. For example, consider the following scenario:\n// foo/bar.proto syntax = \"proto2\"; message Bar {} // foo/baz.proto syntax = \"proto2\"; import \"bar.proto\"; message Baz { optional Bar bar = 1; } If you invoke protoc like so, it will work correctly:\n$ protoc --ruby_out=. -Ifoo foo/bar.proto foo/baz.proto $ RUBYLIB=. ruby baz_pb.rb However if you invoke protoc like so, and didn’t have any compatibility code, it would fail to load:\n$ protoc --ruby_out=. -I. -Ifoo foo/baz.proto $ protoc --ruby_out=. -I. -Ifoo foo/bar.proto $ RUBYLIB=foo ruby foo/baz_pb.rb foo/baz_pb.rb:10:in `add_serialized_file': Unable to build file to DescriptorPool: Depends on file 'bar.proto', but it has not been loaded (Google::Protobuf::TypeError) from foo/baz_pb.rb:10:in `\u003cmain\u003e' The problem is that bar.proto is being referred to by two different canonical names: bar.proto and foo/bar.proto. This is a user error: each import should always be referred to by a consistent full path. Hopefully user errors of this sort will be rare, but it is hard to know without trying.\nThe code in this change prints a warning using warn if we detect that this edge case has occurred:\n$ RUBYLIB=foo ruby foo/baz_pb.rb Warning: Protobuf detected an import path issue while loading generated file foo/baz_pb.rb - foo/baz.proto imports bar.proto, but that import was loaded as foo/bar.proto Each proto file must use a consistent fully-qualified name. This will become an error in the next major version. There are two possible fixes in this case. One is to consistently use the name bar.proto for the import (removing -I.). The other is to consistently use the name foo/bar.proto for the import (changing the import line to import \"foo/bar.proto\" and removing -Ifoo).\nWe plan to remove this compatibility code in the next major version.\nDropping Support for Bazel \u003c5.3 v23 will drop support for Bazel 4. Protobuf will continue to support the Bazel 5 LTS with Bazel 5.3 as the minimum required version. This is per the build support policy described in Foundational C++ Support Policy and as reflected in the versions in Foundational C++ Support.\nSyntax Reflection Deprecation v23 will deprecate the ability to check syntax version using reflection. The deprecation will be included as warnings at build time. The capability will be removed in a future release.\n","categories":"","description":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers version 23.x.","excerpt":"Changes announced for Protocol Buffers version 23.x.","ref":"/news/v23/","tags":"","title":"News Announcements for Version 23.x"},{"body":"The following announcements are specific to Version 24.x.

C++: always_print_default_values is replaced with always_print_fields_with_no_presence=True. Py: including_default_value_fields=True is replaced with always_print_fields_with_no_presence=True. The new flag behaves identically to the old flag on proto3 messages, but no longer applies to proto2 optional fields. The old flags applied to proto2 optional fields but not proto3 optional fields.\nPoison Pilling Gencode / Runtime Mismatches Per our Cross-Version Runtime Guarantees, Protobuf does not support mixing generated code and runtimes across major version boundaries, or mixing generated code from a newer version of protoc with older runtimes within a single major runtime version. We plan to introduce “poison pills” to detect and enforce these disallowed mismatches.\nThis is not considered a breaking change since this simply adds enforcement of existing policies, but may require users to update their generated code.\nC++ Breaking Changes In v26, we are planning a major version bump for C++ as per our breaking changes policy and version support policy.\nThe following sections outline the set of breaking changes that we plan to include in the 26.0 release of protocol buffers.

These are potential breaking changes to be aware of, but they may not happen in this particular release, or they may not happen at all.\nRemove deprecated clear APIs on repeated fields The following deprecated methods are removed:\nRepeatedPtrField::ReleaseCleared() RepeatedPtrField::ClearedCount() RepeatedPtrField::AddCleared() Remove C++ legacy syntax descriptor APIs With the release of editions, syntax is no longer supported for business logic. Instead, use the various feature helpers defined in descriptor.h to query more targeted behaviors, such as has_presence, to query features in C++.\nRemove deprecated syntax accessor We plan to remove the deprecated syntax accessor, FileDescriptor::Syntax, in v26. We recommend using the getters from FileDescriptor::edition instead.\nRemove deprecated SupportsUnknownEnumValues method The SupportsUnknownEnumValues method was deprecated in March, 2023. We plan to remove it in v26.\nRemove std::string error collector overrides We are planning to remove the deprecated std::string methods in error collectors.\nJava Breaking Changes In v26, we are planning a major version bump for Java per our breaking changes policy and version support policy.\nThe following sections outline the set of breaking changes that we plan to include in the 26.0 release of protocol buffers. Note that plans can and do change. These are potential breaking changes to be aware of, but they may not happen in this particular release, or they may not happen at all.\nBreaking Compatibility with Old Generated Code v26.x will break compatibility with generated code from older major versions. Users should regenerate old generated code to be from the same version.\nFor example, GeneratedMessageV3, which was originally introduced for backwards compatibility with generated code from v2.x.x against v3.x.x runtime, will be renamed to GeneratedMessage. Runtimes will be updated to support Editions, which will not be compatible with old generated code.\nThis is in accordance with our existing Cross-Version Runtime Guarantees and is a breaking change.\nRemoving Deprecated Methods/Variables v26.x will remove access to deprecated methods and variables. These will generally have already been marked @Deprecated in a previous release.\nThis will remove access to the following non-exhaustive list:\nDescriptor syntax APIs, which should be replaced with corresponding feature accessors (such as FieldDescriptor.hasPresence(), EnumDescriptor.isClosed())\nTextFormat print methods, which should be replaced by corresponding TextFormat.printer() methods.\nPARSER variable, which should be replaced by the parser() method.\nRuntime methods for old v2.x.x gencode compatibility. This is no longer supported, as per our Cross Version Runtime Guarantees.\nMore details will be available in the corresponding release notes.\nPHP Breaking Changes The following changes are planned for the 26.x line:\nValidate UTF-8 for string fields in setters. Remove generic services. (commit 40ad3fa) Python Breaking Changes In v26, we are planning a major version bump for Python as per our breaking changes policy and version support policy.\nThe following changes are planned for the 26.x line:\nMake str(msg) escape any invalid UTF-8 in string fields. Make text_format.MessageToString() default to outputting raw UTF-8, while escaping any invalid UTF-8 sequences. Fix timestamp bounds (commit 1250d5f) Removing Deprecated APIs In the 26.x release, the following deprecated APIs will be removed:\nAddFileDescriptor AddDescriptor AddEnumDescriptor AddExtensionDescriptor AddServiceDescriptor Rejecting Extend Repeated Field with None Iterable Starting in the 26.x release, extending repeated fields with a None iterable will be rejected (it will raise a TypeError). For example, m.repeated_int32.extend(None) will be rejected.\nRemoving RegisterExtension in message class Starting in the 26.x release, RegisterExtension will be removed. You can access extensions in Python using the Extensions property on message objects.\nThis affects both pure Python and the C++ implementation of Python, but not upb Python.\nRemoving setup.py and setup.cfg support from GitHub In the 26.x release, setup.py and setup.cfg will no longer be present in the python/ directory of the GitHub repository or GitHub release tarballs. This means it will no longer be possible to build a Python package directly from the GitHub repo or release tarball.\nThe Python source packages published on PyPI will continue to have a setup.py in the top-level directory. This is the supported and recommended way of building Python binary packages, for users who do not want to use the binary packages that we distribute on PyPI.\nFor more information, see #15671.\nTimestamps are checked for validity In v26, the system will check if Timestamp values are valid. Seconds must be in the range [-62135596800, 253402300799] and nanos must be in range [0, 999999999]. Values outside those ranges will raise an exception.\nRemove deprecated syntax accessor We plan to remove the deprecated syntax accessor, FileDescriptor.syntax, in v26. We plan to add FileDescriptor.edition in its place.\nUnknownFields support removal In v25 message.UnknownFields() was deprecated in pure Python and C++ extensions. We plan to remove it v26. Use the new UnknownFieldSet(message) support in unknown_fields.py as a replacement.\nMore details about all of these changes will be available in the corresponding release notes.\nRuby Breaking Changes Fix RepeatedField#each_index to have the correct semantics. (#11767) Remove Ruby DSL and associated compatibility code, which will complete the migration announced in April. Message#to_h fixes: Remove unset oneof fields. (#6167) Remove unset sub-message fields Use message’s pool for encode_json/decode_json. Remove the deprecated syntax accessor, FileDescriptor.syntax and add semantic checks in its place: FieldDescriptor.has_presence to test if a field has presence. FieldDescriptor.is_packed to test if a repeated field is packed. FieldDescriptor.requires_utf8_validation to test if a string field requires UTF-8 validation. EnumDescriptor.is_closed to test if an enum is closed. Freeze Is Now Recursive in Ruby Starting in the 26.x line, when freeze is applied it will be applied recursively, affecting all sub-messages, maps, and repeated fields.\nupb Breaking Changes The following changes are planned for the 26.x line:\nFix nonconformance in JSON parsing when IgnoreUnknownEnumString is enabled.
